Credit Card Tools
=================

These are a set of ruby scripts for processing credit cards on the command
line.

Supported processors:

  * PayPal (Business or Premier account required)

Requirements
------------

  * RubyGems
  * ActiveMerchant

Setup - Follow step by step 
-----

Copy gateway.yml.example to gateway.yml and fill in the fields in that file.

There is one block for the "live" environment, where real credit cards are
charged, and one block for the "test" environment, which mocks everything
through PayPal's Sandbox and no real money is exchanged.

Install ActiveMerchant::

  gem install activemerchant

If the following files are not set executable, you should do::

  chmod 755 charge.rb refund.rb

Usage
-----

Commands:

  * charge.rb
  * refund.rb

Run the commands without arguments to see the options.

Example $1.00 charge::

  ./charge.rb 1.00 4111111111111111 02/2012

Example $1.00 refund::

  ./refund.rb 1.00 2TL24258DY409104G

The second argument in the above example is the Auth ID of the original 
transaction.

The output will be a nicely formatted response from PayPal.  The response is
in YAML format, so you could do further processing with your own scripts 
relatively easily.

Other Processors
----------------

ActiveMerchant supports a large list of credit card processors / gateways.
To use these tools with a gateway besides PayPal, modify gateway.rb to suit
your needs.  It should be relatively straight forward.
